                                My journey into the world of development began with a transformative 6-month full stack developer course in 2020. Since then, I&apos;ve been on an exciting path of growth and exploration.

                                From my first role at &quot;Gen IT&quot; in October 2021, I&apos;ve embraced every coding challenge with a passion for continuous improvement. Beyond my work, I dedicate myself to hands-on practice and online courses, always seeking to refine my skills and expand my knowledge.

                                English, while not my native language, is another skill I&apos;m actively enhancing. Completing the CAE course has equipped me to navigate comfortably and communicate effectively.
