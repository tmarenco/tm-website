                                I&apos;m a Full Stack Web Developer with over 3 years of experience working on diverse projects across various industries. My expertise lies in building scalable and efficient web applications with a focus on both the frontend and backend, ensuring seamless user experiences and performance optimization.

                            <p>
                                I specialize in React, Angular, and Next.js, with deep knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript. On the backend, I work with Node.js, building robust APIs and microservices. Additionally, I have familiarity with Java, PHP, and Python, which allows me to adapt easily to different tech stacks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In recent years, I&apos;ve contributed to the development of systems for major enterprises, ranging from insurance to fitness and e-commerce, refactoring legacy codebases, optimizing API performance, and creating responsive, user-centric interfaces.

                                English, while not my native language, is another skill I&apos;m actively enhancing. Achieving proficiency at the C1 level in the Cambridge English: Advanced (CAE) certification has equipped me to navigate comfortably and communicate effectively.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My focus is on front-end development, though I enjoy working on full stack projects. I&apos;m passionate about crafting applications that are not only efficient but also appealing and intuitive for users, bringing new solutions that solve real-world problems. I&apos;m currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis at ORT University to further expand my knowledge and technical skills. I&apos;m always looking to contribute to innovative projects that have a meaningful impact and improve the user experience.
